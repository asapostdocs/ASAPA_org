Boyi is passionate about addressing hidden curriculums and supporting individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n\n\nSean Maden\nSean is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Biostatistics of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He present work is in bias adjustment and best practices for algorithm applications in transcriptomics. Sean is interested in the equitable use of computational tools and code in research, including open-access development and publication of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data in genomics.\n\n\n\nSarah Samorodnitsky\nSarah is a postdoctoral research fellow at Fred Hutch Cancer Center working in the SWOG group. Previously, Sarah co-chaired ENARâ€™s Council for Emerging and New Statisticians (CENS) where she developed an interest in building community among early-career (bio)statisticians/data scientists.\n\n\n\nAnna Seffernick\nAnna Eames Seffernick is a postdoc in the Department of Biostatistics at St.Â Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital and graduate of The Ohio State University. She works on statistical methods for genomic data in pediatric leukemia. Outside of work, Anna enjoys baking, running, and spending time with her husband and dog. She can be found on LinkedIn and GitHub.\n\n\n\nZiqiao Wang\nZiqiao is a postdoctoral fellow in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She has been developing statistical methods to enhance the interpretation and application of polygenic scores in large-scale biobanks. Another direction of her research has been in developing novel methods in integrative omics studies. Ziqiao is currently an executive member of ENARâ€™s Council for Emerging and New Statisticians (CENS). At CENS, she has worked together with Sarah and Anna in building a diverse and inclusive community for early-stage professionals. She can be found at GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to thank the support from ASA and Dr.Â Donna Lalonde."
